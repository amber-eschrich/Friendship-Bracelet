Friendship bracelets are a halmark of crafts and are notorious amongst young girls. While friendship bracelets can take numerous forms, today I will teach you how to make a simple friendship bracelet from string. 

## Materials

- Embroidery Floss, preferably in four different colors of your choice.

## Prep the String

## Make the Knot
2.  Find the middle of all four pieces of string, and put them together, take this center point and create a knot that makes a loop.
